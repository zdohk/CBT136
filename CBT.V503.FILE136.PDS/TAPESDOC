TAPESCAN---FAST TAPE SUMMARY, ANALYSIS, AND COPYING PROGRAM
** HOWARD M. DEAN  05/10/79

GENERAL INFORMATION--


'TAPESCAN' IS A FAST-EXECUTING PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE
THE CONTENTS OF A MAGNETIC TAPE VOLUME WHILE OPTIONALLY COPYING THE TAPE
OR PORTION OF TAPE VIEWED TO ANOTHER TAPE. 'TAPESCAN' IS EXPECIALLY USE-
FUL WHEN THE DATA SET NAMES AND CHARACTERISTICS OR THE INTERNAL (LABEL) OR THE
VOLUME SERIAL OF THE TAPE TO BE SCANNED ARE UNKNOWN. 'TAPESCAN' HAS
THE FOLLOWING FEATURES:


(1) 'TAPESCAN' PRODUCES, FOR VS/370 STANDARD LABELED TAPES, A HIGHLY
    READABLE SUMMARY OF THE CONTENTS OF EACH LABEL FOR EVERY DATA SET
    PROCESSED.  THE LABELS THEMSELVES AS WELL AS SOME DATA BLOCKS ARE
    ALSO LISTED IN BOTH CHARACTER AND HEXIDECIMAL FORMAT.

(2) 'TAPESCAN' IS DESIGNED TO HANDLE A WIDE RANGE OF USER, I/O, AND
    OPERATOR ERRORS.  EXTENSIVE DIAGNOSTICS ARE PROVIDED.

(3) 'TAPESCAN' HAS THE ABILITY TO LOOK PAST THE TWO CONTIGUOUS TAPE
    MARKS OR THE "EOV1" LABEL THAT USUALLY INDICATES THE END OF
    USABLE DATA ON A TAPE VOLUME.

(4) AN ESTIMATE IS PROVIDED OF THE PHYSICAL LENGTH OF THE TAPE SCANNED.

(5) WITH THE 'COPY' OPTION, YOU CAN COPY ANY NUMBER OF FILES FROM ONE
    TAPE TO ANOTHER.  NORMALLY THIS IS DONE ONLY FROM UNLABELED TAPE TO
    UNLABELED TAPE OR STANDARD LABEL TAPE TO STANDARD LABEL TAPE.  WHEN
    COPYING STANDARD LABEL TAPES THE VOLUME LABEL MAY BE COPIED OR THE
    EXISTING VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER OF THE OUTPUT TAPE MAY BE RETAINED.
    IN ADDITION, DATA SETS EXISTING ON THE OUTPUT TAPE MAY BE RETAINED
    WITH THE COPIED DATA SETS FOLLOWING THEM.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE--

'TAPESCAN' IS MOST CONVENIENTLY USED THROUGH ITS CATALOGED PROCEDURE.   O SCAN
 THE FOLLOWING WILL EXPLAIN THE USE OF THE PROCEDURE:

      //  EXEC  TAPESCAN,(PROC SYMBOLIC PARAMETERS)

THE SYMBOLIC PARAMETERS ARE EXPLAINED BELOW (NONE ARE REQUIRED):

      T      =  THE VOLUME SERIAL OF THE INPUT TAPE. EVEN THOUGH
                THE TAPE WILL BE READ AS BLP, THE OPERATOR MUST
                KNOW WHICH TAPE TO MOUNT. IF THIS PARAMETER IS
                OMITTED, THE SERIAL 'VOLSER' WILL BE USED.

      NAME   =  THE DSNAME OF A DATA SET ON THE TAPE. THIS CAN
                REALLY BE ANY NAME BECAUSE LABEL PROCESSING IS
                BYPASSED. IT SHOULD BE INCLUDED FOR OPERATOR
                INFORMATION. NAMES SUCH AS 'MOUNT.TAPE.PLEASE' ARE
                COMMON. THE DEFAULT FOR NAME IS 'INPUT'.

      CLASS  =  THE PRINT OUTPUT CLASS OF THE TAPESCAN SYSPRINT
                FILE. THE DEFAULT IS '*', WHICH WILL PUT THE
                OUTPUT IN THE SAME CLASS A YOUR MESSAGE CLASS.

      TMS    =  THIS PARAMETER IS REQUIRED FOR USE WITH THE
                UCC-1 TAPE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. IT SHOULD BE
                LEFT ALONE UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES. THE
                DEFAULT VALUE IS 98000, WHICH MEANS BYPASS THE
                LOOKUP ON THE TMS CATALOG.


      LBL    =  THE LABEL OF THE FIRST DATASET ON THE TAPE WHICH
                YOU ARE SCANNING. DEFAULT IS LABEL 1, LET THIS
                PARAMETER DEFAULT.

      BLP    =  SPECIFYS THAT LABEL PROCESSING IS TO BE BYPASSED.
                DEFAULT IS BLP. THIS PARAMETER SHOULD ONLY BE
                CHANGED TO WHEN USING THE COPY OPTION AND THE TAPE
                FROM WHICH YOU ARE COPYING HAS STANDARD LABELS.


WHEN USING THE COPY OPTION, A DD CARD MUST BE PROVIDED FOR THE OUTPUT TAPE:

    //   EXEC TAPESCAN,T=_____,PARM=COPY
    //OUTPUT DD UNIT=TAPE,VOL=SER=_____

PRINTED OUTPUT--

MOST OF THE PRINTOUT IS SELF-EXPLANATORY FOR THE MODERATELY EXPERIENCED USER.
SUMMARY INFORMATION FOR A LABEL RECORD IS PRINTED BELOW THE RECORD.  AN APPRO-
PRIATE LABEL IS GIVEN FOR EACH SUMMARIZED PIECE OF INFORMATION.  OTHER INFOR-
MATION NOT SUMMARIZED BY "TAPESCAN" IS DESCRIBED IN THE IBM OS/360 MANUAL
"TAPE LABELS," GC28-6680.  THE LENGTH ESTIMATE, BLOCK COUNT, AND BYTE COUNT
LISTED ARE ONLY FOR THOSE INPUT DATA SETS PROCESSED.  SEE APPENDIX B FOR MORE
INFORMATION ON THE LENGTH ESTIMATE.  THE PHYSICAL DENSITY OF NINE TRACK TAPES
CAN BE CHECKED BY LOOKING AT THE "DEN" VALUE SPECIFIED IN THE LENGTH ESTIMATE.
THE DENSITY VALUE STORED IN THE LABELS CAN BE WRONG.  A RETURN CODE OF 8 IS
PROVIDED FOR TERMINAL ERRORS;  0 FOR NONTERMINAL ERRORS OR NO ERRORS.
THE LABEL INFORMATION IS REPEATED IN A TABULAR FORM AT THE END OF THE RUN.


PARAMETERS--

THESE PARAMETERS ARE PLACED IN THE PARM FIELD OF THE EXEC STATEMENT.  THEY
START AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PARM FIELD AND ARE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
BY COMMAS WITH NO INTERVENING BLANKS.  EXAMPLE:

    //   EXEC  TAPESCAN,PARM=(LIST10,NOHEX,ERRLIM15),...

NOCOUNT  THIS CAUSES "TAPESCAN" TO AVOID READING EVERY BLOCK OF THE
         DATA SETS IT PROCESSES.  AS A RESULT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION
         IS NOT REPORTED:  (1) THE NUMBER OF PHYSICAL BLOCKS ACTUALLY IN
         THE DATA SET;  (2) THE MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, AND AVERAGE BLOCK LENGTHS
         IN THE DATA SET;  (3) THE TAPE LENGTH ESTIMATE;  (4) THE TOTAL
         NUMBER OF BYTES IN THE DATA SETS PROCESSED.  ONCE OTHER INFORMATION
         HAS BEEN PROCESSED, A FORWARD SPACE FILE I/O COMMAND IS ISSUED.
         THIS CUTS DOWN THE I/O CHARGE BUT TIES UP THE SELECTOR SUB-
         CHANNEL.  THUS, ITS USE IS NOT RECOMENDED.  "NOCOUNT" IS
         INVALID WITH "COPY" OR "EOVMOD".

COPY     THIS OPTION CAUSES THE COPYING OF DATA AND TAPE MARKS FROM THE
         INPUT TAPE TO THE OUTPUT TAPE.  FOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF
         COPYING SEE APPENDIX C.

NOVOLSER DURING A TAPE COPYING OPERATION, THIS SPECIFIES THAT THE
         INPUT VOLUME LABEL RECORD, IF ANY, IS NOT TO BE COPIED TO
         THE OUTPUT TAPE AND THE VOLUME LABEL RECORD ON THE OUTPUT
         TAPE, IF ANY, IS TO BE LEFT AS IT IS.  "NOVOLSER" IS IGNORED
         UNLESS "COPY" IS ALSO SPECIFIED.  FURTHER DETAILS CAN BE
         FOUND IN APPENDIX C.

EOVMOD   COPIES THE INPUT TAPE FOLLOWING THE LAST EXISTING DATA SET OF
         THE OUTPUT TAPE.  IMPLIES "COPY".

LIST___  "TAPESCAN" NORMALLY LISTS ONE LINE'S WORTH OF THE FIRST FOUR
         BLOCKS FOLLOWING A TAPE MARK OR THE LOAD POINT.  BY SPECIFYING
         "LIST___", WHERE THE BLANK IS FILLED IN WITH A NUMBER BETWEEN
         ZERO AND TWO BILLION, ONE CAN MAKE "TAPESCAN" LIST EITHER MORE
         OR FEWER BLOCKS.

NOLIST   SAME AS "LIST0".

NOHEX    SUPPRESSES PRINTING OF THE TWO LINES OF HEXADECIMAL CHARACTERS
         THAT NORMALLY APPEAR BELOW THE CHARACTER LISTING OF EACH BLOCK
         PRINTED.  NOTE THAT THE HEX EQUIVALENT OF EACH BYTE APPEARS
         PRINTED VERTICALLY:

            -NOW IS THE TIME....
         4446DDE4CE4ECC4ECDC444444
         0000566092038503945BBBB00

NOSUMMARY
         SUPPRESSES THE EXTENDED DESCRIPTION OF ANY LABEL RECORDS THAT
         MAY BE ENCOUNTERED ON AN IBM STANDARD LABELED TAPE.  IN ADDITION,
         THE "VTOC" LISTING AT THE END OF THE OUTPUT IS SUPPRESSED.

MAXTM___ "TAPESCAN" NORMALLY PROCESSES ALL OF THE TAPE MARKS UP TO AND
         INCLUDING THE PAIR OF TAPE MARKS OR THE "EOV1" LABEL THAT
         INDICATES LOGICAL END OF VOLUME.  SPECIFYING MAXTM___ SETS A
         LOWER LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF TAPE MARKS PROCESSED CAUSING
         TERMINATION AFTER THE INDICATED NUMBER OF TAPE MARKS OR END
         OF VOLUME, WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST.

SKIPTM___
         "TAPESCAN" NORMALLY STARTS WITH THE FIRST DATA SET ON THE
         TAPE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE LOAD POINT.  "SKIPTM___"
         CAUSES THE INDICATED NUMBER OF TAPE MARKS TO BE SKIPPED
         FIRST.  AS WITH "MAXTM__", "SKIPTM__" WILL NOT GO PAST
         THE LOGICAL END OF VOLUME.

MAXEOV__ THIS RESETS THE MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF LOGICAL
         END-OF-VOLUME INDICATIONS THAT MAY BE PROCESSED.  USE OF
         THIS PARAMETER IS NECESSARY FOR SCANNING BEYOND THE FIRST
         LOGICAL END OF VOLUME.  NEITHER "MAXTM___" NOR "MAXEOV__"
         IS EXCEEDED.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON RETREIVING INFORMATION
         "LOST" PAST END-OF-VOLUME, SEE APPENDIX A.

SKIPEOV__
         THIS CAUSES BYPASSING OF THE INDICATED NUMBER OF LOGICAL
         END-OF-VOLUME INDICATIONS BEFORE PROCESSING OF DATA STARTS.
         "MAXEOV__" MUST BE SET AT LEAST ONE GREATER THAN "SKIPEOV__"
         FOR ANY PROCESSING TO OCCUR.  IF BOTH "SKIPEOV__" AND
         "SKIPTM__" ARE SPECIFIED, THEN SKIPPING OCCURS UNTIL BOTH
         ARE SATISIFIED (WHICHEVER REQUIRES THE MOST SKIPPING).

ERRLIM___
         TAPE I/O ERRORS ARE COUNTED BY "TAPESCAN".  NORMALLY
         EXECUTION IS TERMINATED IF 50 ERRORS ARE ENCOUNTERED.
         "ERRLIM___" CAN BE USED TO CHANGE THIS LIMIT.


SOURCE OF PROGRAM--

AN EARLY VERSION OF "TAPESCAN", CALLED "PRECI", WAS WRITTEN BY DOUGLAS CLAPP OF
THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF EPIDEMIOLOGY.  THE CURRENT
VERSION WAS WRITTEN BY WILL DALAND OF THE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN SOCIAL
SCIENCE AT UNC AND PURCHASED FOR USE AT GSFC BY THE SPACE AND APPLICATIONS
COMPUTING CENTER.  LOCAL MODIFICATIONS AND INFORMATION IS BEING PROVIDED BY
RANDY BARTH.



***APPENDIX A:  GOING PAST LOGICAL END OF VOLUME***

AFTER YOU HAVE USED "TAPESCAN" TO EYEBALL THE CONTENTS OF A TAPE FOLLOWING AN
END OF VOLUME INDICATION YOU MAY WANT TO RETRIEVE SOME OF IT.  THIS CAN BE
DONE USING JCL LIKE THE FOLLOWING:

    //   EXEC  TAPESCAN,PARM=(NOLIST,COPY,MAXEOV2,SKIPEOV1),T=____
    //OUTPUT DD UNIT=2400-9,VOL=SER=_____

THIS WILL COPY FROM THE FIRST TO SECOND END-OF-VOLUME INDICATIONS.  IT OFTEN
HAPPENS THAT THE DATA SET IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE LOGICAL END OF VOLUME
CONTAINS I/O ERRORS IN ITS FIRST BLOCK CAUSED BY THE OVERWRITTING OF THE EOV.
EROPT=ABE IS DEFAULTED IN THE PROGRAM, BUT MAY BE CHANGED BY OVERRIDING
"EROPT=___" ON THE DD CARD.  THE CHOICE DEPENDS ON HOW THE BAD BLOCK IS TO
BE HANDLED.  IF ACCEPTED, THE BAD BLOCK MAY NOT BE PROCESSABLE BY NORMAL
PROGRAMS (PARTICULARLY RECFM=V DATA).  THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE CORRECTED OFTEN
BY FURTHER USES OF "TAPESCAN" WITH VARIOUS DCB OVERRIDES.  VARIOUS DETAILS AND
LIKELY PROBLEMS RELATED TO GOING PAST END-OF-VOLUME INDICATIONS ARE NOT
HERE.  EVEN EXPERIENCED USERS SHOULD CONSIDER CONSULTING THE MANUAL BEFORE
ATTEMPTING TO RECOVER SUCH DATA.



***APPENDIX B:  LENGTH ESTIMATION***

THE LENGTH ESTIMATE IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS:

(1) THE LENGTH OF A TAPE MARK IS 3.75 INCHES FOR 9 TRACK TAPES.

(2) THE EFFECTIVE LENGTH OF AN INTERBLOCK GAP IS .601 INCHES FOR 800
    BPI NINE TRACK, .651 FOR 1600 BPI.

(3) THE DENSITY OF THE TAPE FOR 9 TRACK TAPES IS SENSED AFTER THE
    LAST TAPE MARK PROCESSED IS READ, REGARDLESS OF THE DENSITY
    SPECIFIED IN THE DCB OR SENSED AT THE LOAD POINT.

(4) IF THE LENGTH ESTIMATE IS MADE FOR A PORTION OF A TAPE BETWEEN
    TWO TAPE MARKS, THE LAST TAPEMARK IS INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE, BUT
    THE FIRST IS NOT.  DUE TO ROUNDING ERRORS THE ESTIMATE MAY BE AS
    MUCH AS TWO INCHES LESS THAN THE ABOVE SPECIFICATIONS INDICATE.

(5) I/O ERRORS CAN INVALIDATE RESULTS.  MINOR DATA CHECKS AND NOISE
    USUALLY DO NOT CAUSE MUCH INACCURACY.  BYTES READ IN I/O ERRORS
    ARE COUNTED IN THE BYTE TOTAL JUST LIKE OTHER BYTES.  I/O ERRORS
    TEND TO MAKE THE LENGTH ESTIMATE SMALLER THAN THE ACTUAL LENGTH.


***APPENDIX C:  COPYING TAPES WITH "TAPESCAN"***

COPYING ALL OR PART OF A TAPE IS ACCOMPLISHED BY USING THE PARAMETER "COPY" IN
THE EXEC STATEMENT AND PROVIDING AN "OUTPUT" DD STATEMENT DEFINING THE OUTPUT
TAPE.  THE FILES COPIED ARE ALL THOSE PROCESSED ON THE INPUT TAPE.  THE
LOCATION ON THE OUTPUT TAPE OF THE FIRST FILE TO BE WRITTEN MAY BE DEFINED IN
THE LABEL PARAMETER OF THE OUTPUT TAPE'S DD CARD.  THIS DATA SET SEQUENCE
NUMBER IS SPECIFIED AS THOUGH IT WERE FOR AN UNLABELED TAPE, REGARDLESS OF THE
PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF LABELS (I.E., LABELS ARE COUNTED AS DATA SETS FOR THIS
PURPOSE).  THUS, "LABEL=(4,SL)" REFERS TO THE HEADER LABEL FILE WHICH PRECEEDS
THE SECOND OS DATA SET ON THE TAPE.  PHYSICAL FILES ARE COPIED EXACTLY EXCEPT
FOR "NOVOLSER" PROCESSING.  FOR THE PURPOSE OF "NOVOLSER" PROCESSING, AN INPUT
VOLUME LABEL IS DEFINED AS THE FIRST DATA BLOCK AFTER THE LOAD POINT REGARDLESS
OF LENGTH OR OTHER CHARACTERISTICS.  AN OUTPUT VOLUME LABEL IS DEFINED AS
EITHER AN IBM STANDARD VOLUME LABEL OR AN ANSI VOLUME LABEL IMMEDIATELY
FOLLOWING THE LOAD POINT.  A TAPE IS TREATED AS NOT HAVING A VOLUME LABEL
IF ITS JCL LABEL PARAMETER IS NL, LTM, OR BLP.  IF THE OUTPUT TAPE'S FILE
SEQUENCE NUMBER IS 1 (OR 0) AND AL, AUL, SL, OR SUL IS SPECIFIED, THEN THE TAPE
IS CHECKED TO MAKE SURE IT HAS EITHER THE PROPER IBM OR ANSI STANDARD LABELS.
NOTE THAT THE VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER IS CHECKED FOR SL LABELS BUT NOT FOR AL.
IF AN IMPROPER LABEL IS DETECTED THEN PROCESSING IS TERMINATED.  IF EITHER THE
INPUT OR OUTPUT TAPE HAS A LEGITIMATE VOLUME LABEL THEN NEITHER NL NOR LTM MAY
BE SPECIFIED FOR THAT TAPE.  THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATES COPYING OF THE SECOND
AND THIRD FILES OF A NINE  TRACK UNLABELED TAPE ONTO THE EIGTH AND NINTH FILES
OF ANOTHER UNLABELED TAPE:

    //   EXEC  TAPESCAN,PARM=(COPY,SKIPTM1,MAXTM3),T=XX7777
    //OUTPUT DD UNIT=TAPE,VOL=SER=YY9999,LABEL=(8,BLP)

AN IMPLIED SL SPECIFICATION ON THE OUTPUT DD CARD IS MODIFIED BY "TAPESCAN"
TO BLP.  AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, WE COPY THE FIRST TWO SL FILES FROM ONE TAPE
TO BECOME THE FORTH AND FIFTH SL FILES ON ANOTHER TAPE:

    //   EXEC TAPESCAN,PARM=(COPY,MAXTM6,NOTSER),VOL=INTAPE
    //OUTPUT DD UNIT=2400-9,VOL=SER=OUTTAP,LABEL=(10,BLP)

THE DATA SET SEQUENCE NUMBERS IN THE LABELS REMAIN ONE AND TWO RESPECTIVELY
EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOW LOCATED AS FILES FOUR AND FIVE.  EXPERIMENTS INDICATE
THAT THE COPIED FILES CAN BE REFERENCED AS FILES FOUR AND FIVE THROUGH STANDARD
OS JCL (I.E., "LABEL=(4,SL)").  THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED BY IBM, HOWEVER.

USING THE "EOVMOD" PARAMETER CAUSES ALL THE DATA SETS UP TO BUT NOT INCLUDING
THE LOGICAL END-OF-VOLUME INDICATOR ON THE OUTPUT TAPE TO BE BYPASSED BEFORE
COPYING BEGINS.  THIS, OF NECESSITY, IMPLIES "NOVOLSER" PROCESSING.

"TAPESCAN" AND OTHER PROGRAMS USING THE SAME TAPE(S) IN THE SAME JOB SOMETIMES
DO NOT MIX TOO WELL.  IF YOU MUST DO THIS, THEN USE A DISPOSITION OF "KEEP"
AND DO NOT USE "VOL=(,RETAIN,...)".
